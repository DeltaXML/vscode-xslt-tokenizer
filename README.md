### Creating XSLT Transform Tasks

VSCode uses Tasks to integrate with external tools. Described in [Tasks in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks)

This extension provides a 'Saxon XSLT' task that will be shown when a workspace folder is open and the **Create Task** command is invoked from VSCode.

A Saxon XSLT task is first created with default settings for an XSLT transform. The default settings can be edited later within the ```tasks.json``` file.

To use the Saxon XSLT task, you must also have Saxon and Java installed on your machine. The Saxon task file values can make use of VSCode built-in variables. The built-in variables supported are described in the [VS Code Variables Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/variables-reference).
